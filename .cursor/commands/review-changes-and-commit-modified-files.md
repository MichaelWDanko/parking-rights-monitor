Look at each of the files that have been modified since we last made a commit.

You should write a concise but straightforward commit message that describes the commits as a present tense description of what the changes implement. See the examples below:

- "Adds capability to add new records"
- "Removes unnecessary functions that aren't being used."

Propose the commit message for me to review. After I confirm it looks good, I want you to add all of the files to a commit. If you run into access issues and cannot make the commit yourself, you should share the command line command I need to run to do it myself.
