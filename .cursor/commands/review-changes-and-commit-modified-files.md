Look at each of the files that have been modified since we last made a commit.

You should write a concise but straightforward commit message that describes the commits as a present tense description of what the changes implement. See the examples below:

- "Adds capability to add new records"
- "Removes unnecessary functions that aren't being used."

Propose the commit message for me to review and then ask me if it looks good. If I say yes or approve of the message, attempt to commit the changes yourself.

Only if you run into access issues and cannot make the commit yourself, you should share the command line command I need to run to do it myself.
